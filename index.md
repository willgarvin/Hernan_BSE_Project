# Smart Mirror
With a Raspberry Pi and a few other components, the Smart Mirror is a customizable mirror that projects a computer display over a traditional reflective mirror. Some possible uses include displaying the time, a calendar, picture, or other applications in your reflection. You will be transported to a sci-fi world in the comfort of your home!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

My starter project was assembling and soldering all the necessary components onto my circuit borad for my "TV-B Gone" project. The resonator, electrolytic capacitor, transistors, infared LEDs, and resistores, to ensure that my TV-B Gone functions properly. Due to the relative simplicity of the project, it was simple to assemble, however it was fun to research and learn about the different components of the TV-B Gone and how it relates to the functioning of a television. I leanred how the resonator acts as a timing clock that keeps the chip on time and generate precise waveforms. Electrolytic capacitors generally, this device uses electrolyte, which is a liquid gel with a high concentration of ions, to increase the capacitance, which allows for greater energy-storing and collecting. In televisions, infrared is used to send signals from the remote (the transmitter), and the TV itself (the receiver). The LEDs act as a transmitter. The LEDs emit an infrared signal in a special sequence of 0’s and 1’s, binary,  to tell the television to “shut off”. This strater project served as an introduction to soldering as well as a way to grow my researching capabilities
